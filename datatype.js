//<!-- //datatypes store diffrent types of data
types
//1. primitive data types(stoers values that are constant)
//you cant store a primitive data type and then store a string in it
//eg: numbers(int,float),boolen,string,null,undefined,symbol,bigint

//numbers

//boolen
//a value that onlt takes and generates two outputs 

let itsunny=true;
let itsrainny=false;
//strings
//a sequence of character such as names, sentences, paragraphs
//they are enclosed in quotes

let myname="Faith"
let mysecondname="Mutanu"
let myfullname=
 






//COMPLEX DATA TYPES //nonprimitive data types
//
//eg objects ,arrays......

//objects

//let person = {
    //name:"Faith"
   // age="20"
   // occupation ="student"
//}

///arrays

//variables...fruits..let, const,var
//diffrent types of naming conventions in programingCamel Case: Used for naming variables, functions, and methods (e.g., myVariable, calculateTotal).
//Pascal Case: Capitalizes the first letter of each word (e.g., MyVariable, CalculateTotal).
//Snake Case: Uses underscores between words (e.g., my_variable, calculate_total).
//Kebab Case (Spinal Case): Uses hyphens between words (e.g., my-variable, calculate-total).
//Hungarian Notation: Prefixes variable names with type information (e.g., strName, intCount).
//camelcase:capitalise all first letters of the major words apart from the first word
